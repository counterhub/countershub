Countershub Project Roadmap

Vision

Countershub is a clean, modern hub for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes
(SWGOH) counters. It’s designed to be more user-friendly than swgoh.gg
by focusing on clarity, speed, and extra filtering options like Omicrons
(OMI) and Datacrons (DC).

The goal: help players and guild leaders instantly find the right
counter for every GAC, TW, and Fleet matchup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Core User Experience

-   Simple selection flow: Choose mode first (GAC, TW, Fleets).
-   Filtering: Omicron, Datacron, or OMI+DC variants of squads.
-   Confidence scoring: Instead of hard/soft labels, use a 1–10 scale
    with colors (pain scale style).
-   Visual design:
    -   Star Wars feel (sci-fi, holo effect, space backgrounds).
    -   Character/fleet icons with labels below (since
        helmets/duplicates look similar).
    -   Red vs Blue side accents for DS/LS.
-   Mobile-first: Optimized layout for smartphones (most players will
    use phones during TW/GAC).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tech Foundation

-   Framework: Next.js (v14+), hosted on Vercel.
-   Repo: GitHub (main branch only, clean structure).
-   Data: JSON files for counters (gac.json, tw.json, fleets.json).
-   Code organization:
    -   app/ → routes and pages (GAC, TW, Fleets).
    -   components/ → cards, search UI, squad/fleet views.
    -   lib/ → helper functions (e.g., YouTube fetcher).
    -   public/ → images, silhouettes, and placeholders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature Pipeline

1.  MVP (live ASAP)
    -   Core counter data (at least 50 squads, each with 3+ counters).
    -   Mode switching (GAC / TW / Fleets).
    -   Confidence scale UI.
    -   Character placeholders with names.
    -   Static images + data (self-contained).
2.  Enhancements
    -   Search and filter (by name, tags, faction).
    -   Auto-updating counters via YouTube API scraping.
    -   Guild-leader-friendly layouts (clean, fast to read).
    -   Submission system for proofs (videos/screenshots, blurred
        opponent names).
3.  Future
    -   Discord bot integration for counter lookups.
    -   User favorites / squad planning tool.
    -   Percentage winrates (once enough data is collected).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues (Past Debugging)

-   Vercel falsely detected TypeScript → traced to stray .ts files and
    tsconfig.json.
-   Duplicate folders (countershubfinal inside countershubfinal)
    confused deployments.
-   Clearing Vercel cache and restructuring the repo was required.
-   Added .jsconfig.json to explicitly define JS-only build.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Steps

1.  Confirm JS-only repo (no .ts, no tsconfig.json).
2.  Push clean repo to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy.
3.  Lock in MVP deployment (counters visible, basic flow works).
4.  Begin enhancements (search, OMI/DC variations, YouTube fetcher).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Notes

Countershub isn’t just a clone of swgoh.gg — it’s your streamlined
version with better filtering and presentation. The long-term vision is
to become the first-stop tool for guild leaders and competitive players
who need reliable, updated counter data in seconds.
