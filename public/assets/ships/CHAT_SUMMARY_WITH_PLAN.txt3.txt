# CountersHub Project - Chat Summary & Action Plan

## Project Vision
CountersHub is a Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) counters website designed to improve upon swgoh.gg by being:
- Cleaner, faster, and easier to use.
- Automated to scrape counters from trusted sources (swgoh.gg, Reddit, YouTube).
- Scored with a 1–10 confidence rating (red → green) instead of swgoh.gg percentages.
- Capable of storing and linking proof videos (with player submissions manually verified).
- Designed to eventually self-generate reliable counters with collected data.

The long-term goal: **A one-stop counter hub for fleets, GAC, TW, and more.**

---

## Current Progress
- ✅ Repo is live on GitHub and connected to Vercel.
- ✅ Ship assets uploaded to `public/assets/ships/`.
- ✅ JSON data structured for fleets, gac-3v3, gac-5v5, tw.
- ✅ JSX pages rendering data from JSON (fleets, gac, tw).  
- ✅ Local dev environment works (pages rendering properly).

- ⚠ Build fails on Vercel due to **bad relative import paths** (e.g., `../../../data/tw.json`).
- ⚠ Imports need cleanup with a `jsconfig.json` baseUrl and `paths` to simplify JSON imports (`@/data/tw.json` instead of `../../../data/tw.json`).
- ⚠ TW page currently imports JSON correctly but fails to resolve path in production.
- ⚠ Need cleanup of unnecessary files (e.g., `tree.txt`) and consistency in Git pushes.

## Immediate Next Steps (Action Plan)

### 1. Fix Import Paths
- Create `jsconfig.json` in project root with:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```
- Update imports across JSX files:  
  Example:  
  ```js
  import tw from "@/data/tw.json";
  import fleets from "@/data/fleets.json";
  import gac3v3 from "@/data/gac-3v3.json";
  import gac5v5 from "@/data/gac-5v5.json";
  ```

### 2. Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor imports to use jsconfig.json paths"
git push
```

### 3. Redeploy on Vercel
- Trigger a new deployment to confirm `module not found` errors are resolved.

### 4. Clean & Verify Repo
- Ensure `.gitignore` properly excludes local-only files (e.g., logs, temp text files).
- Keep repo clean for smooth Vercel deployments.

## Medium-Term Tasks
- Add admin dashboard for verifying and approving proof videos.
- Add scraping automation (swgoh.gg, Reddit, YouTube) → will need Node.js backend or external service.
- Add counter confidence rating logic (1–10 with color scale).
- Improve styling and layout (polish to look better than swgoh.gg).

---

## Long-Term Goals
- Fully automated counter discovery system.
- Expand beyond fleets → TW, GAC, Omicrons, Datacrons.
- Build a player community around verified counter submissions.
